Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Client wanted a game called Draw It or Lose It. It was a web-based game that is similar to the 1980's television show Win, Lose or draw. It takes 4 rounds at 1 minute each where the picture is rendered until its completed at 30 seconds. If the team does not answer in time the remaining teams have a chance to steal the question within 15 seconds. The type of software that needed to be designed was a port from the android version to another operating system. The recommended operating system was windows. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did well was describing the hardware of the system needed to run the game. I build my own computers so its easier for me to talk about hardware compatibilities and know the minimum specification to run games at their optimal settings. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
What I found helpful about the design document is that it set up the basics, so all the requirements were set before the coding needed to be done. It set everything out so all that needed to be done was the coding.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise anything I would revise the first part of the design project. I didn’t summarize the project enough and didn’t set the requirements correctly. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to add all the users needs within the project by reading their needs and adding them into the document. It’s important to add the users needs into the project because if this was a real situation the client is paying me to make their program. They should have all the features they want since I would be working for them.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
How I started the approach was reading and taking notes on the needs from the requirements that the client wanted. What I would do differently in the future would be taking more notes on the clients needs and have a better understanding on what the client wants for their program.
